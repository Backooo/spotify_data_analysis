# spotify_data_analysis
Your very own **Spotify Wrapped** for any time of the year

## Overview

This project aims at analyzing data from the Spotify API to visualize your own custom Spotify Wrapped that can be accessed any time of the year. I am to allow users to genereate their music listenings statistics for any custom time range.

Key features I want to include:
- Custom date range selection
- Visualization of top artists, songs, and genres over selected period
- data presentation in a user-friendly interface

## Dependencies
- spotipy (To interact with the Spotify Web API)
- pandas (To analyse data)
- matplotlib (For static visualizations)
- dotenv (handle Spotify API credentials without hardcoding)
